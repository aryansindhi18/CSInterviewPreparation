- What is hoisting in JS? How does it work? Does hoisting work with all variables, and why?
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and functions are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase before code execution. Var declarations are hoisted and initialized with undefined, whereas let and const declarations are hoisted but remain uninitialized (temporarily in a "temporal dead zone").
Hoisting works differently with functions as wellâ€”function declarations are hoisted with their definition, while function expressions are hoisted without their definition.
